# Approach 1: ETE3 Toolkit

## Status: Blocked

### Issue
ETE3 has compatibility issues with Python 3.13 (missing `cgi` module which was removed from Python 3.13).

### Attempted Solution
Basic radial tree implementation with Newick format and circular layout.

### Pros (Theoretical)
- Specialized for phylogenetic trees
- Built-in radial/circular layouts
- Good for scientific visualizations

### Cons
- Python 3.13 incompatibility
- Would require downgrading to Python 3.11 or earlier
- Less control over fine-grained styling

### Next Steps
- Proceed with Matplotlib/Plotly approach first
- May revisit with Python 3.11 if other approaches fail
