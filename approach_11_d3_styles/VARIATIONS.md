# AI Evolution Tree - Variations for Comparison

Created multiple variations to compare side-by-side. Open each in your browser to see the different approaches.

## Variation A: Vertical Semicircular Fan
**File:** `style6_vertical_phylogenetic.html`
- Time flows from center outward (radial)
- Semicircular fan layout (like biological trees)
- 114 models with smooth curves
- Clean, scientific aesthetic

## Variation B: Horizontal Timeline Flow
**File:** `variation_b_horizontal.html`
- Time flows left → right
- Traditional phylogenetic tree layout
- Dense vertical packing
- All branches visible at once

## Variation C: Ultra-Dense Circular
**File:** `variation_c_dense_circular.html`
- Maximum information density
- Full circular layout (360°)
- All 114 models tightly packed
- Emphasizes explosive growth

## Variation D: Vertical Dendrogram
**File:** `variation_d_vertical_dendro.html`
- Strict vertical orientation
- Time flows bottom → top
- Hierarchical tree structure
- Clean, organized branching

## Variation E: Hand-Drawn Organic
**File:** `variation_e_organic.html`
- Artistic, sketch-like aesthetic
- Organic flowing curves
- Natural, less geometric
- Museum illustration style

## Variation F: Transformer Explosion
**File:** `variation_f_explosion.html`
