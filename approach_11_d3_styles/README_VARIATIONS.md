# AI Evolution Tree Visualizations - Quick Comparison Guide

## üéØ How to Review

Open each HTML file in your browser and compare:
1. **Density** - How many models are visible?
2. **Clarity** - Can you trace lineages easily?
3. **Aesthetics** - Does it feel like art?
4. **Structure** - Does it match the biological phylogenetic tree style?

## üìä Current Variations

### Style 6: Vertical Semicircular (CREATED)
- **Best for:** Traditional phylogenetic tree look
- **Layout:** Semicircular fan, time flows radially outward
- **Density:** Moderate
- **All 114 models:** ‚úÖ

### Creating Next:
- Variation B: Horizontal Timeline (dense, traditional)
- Variation C: Ultra-Dense Circular (maximum info density)
- Variation D: Vertical Dendrogram (strict hierarchy)
- Variation E: Organic Hand-Drawn (artistic)
- Variation F: Transformer Explosion (dramatic)

## üîç What to Look For

Compare each to your `evolution.png` reference:
- Does it have that same dense, organic quality?
- Can you see the explosive diversification?
- Is time progression clear?
- Are color families distinguishable?
- Does it work as art you'd frame?

Let me know which variation(s) are closest, and I'll refine from there!
