# Radial Explosion Variations

Creating multiple approaches to the "fountain explosion" phylogenetic tree:

## Variation A: EXPLOSION (just created)
- 10x width expansion (200 â†’ 2000px)
- S-curve branches with Bezier
- Bottom-to-top layout

## Creating next:

### Variation B: TIGHT_EXPLOSION
- Even more dramatic compression at bottom
- Wider sweep angles
- Tighter early years, explosive late years

### Variation C: ORGANIC_FOUNTAIN  
- Hand-drawn aesthetic
- Natural flowing curves
- River delta style branching

### Variation D: CLASSIC_PHYLO
- Most similar to biological evolution.png
- Traditional phylogenetic aesthetic
- Maximum density

Let me create these 3 more variations now...
