# üéØ Radial Explosion Tree - Ready to View!

## ‚úÖ Just Created: Style 6 EXPLOSION

**File:** `style6_EXPLOSION.html`

### What's Different (The Fix):
‚úÖ **Radial fountain explosion** - narrow at bottom (200px), WIDE at top (2000px) 
‚úÖ **10x width expansion** - dramatically widens as time progresses
‚úÖ **Sweeping S-curves** - branches curve outward organically, not straight lines
‚úÖ **Proper spread** - 2020s are 10x wider than 1960s
‚úÖ **All 114 models** included

### How It Works:
- Perceptron at bottom = narrow trunk
- As you move up through years, tree explodes outward
- Branches sweep left and right in graceful curves
- Top (2025) spreads across full canvas width
- Creates fountain/fireworks effect

## Next:
Tell me if this is closer! I can create 2-3 more variations with:
- Different explosion ratios
- Different curve styles
- Different density levels
- Hand-drawn aesthetic
- Etc.

The key fix: WIDTH EXPANDS DRAMATICALLY from bottom to top, with sweeping curved branches!
